### 错误捕获

> JS 错误捕获一般需要关注三种异常
- 资源加载异常
- JS执行异常
- 未捕获的Promise

:::note
 对于资源加载的异常,可以通过 addEventListener，对error事件进行捕获(也就是addEventListener的第三个参数为true)来对资源加载错误进行处理，
 对于Js执行的异常通过，window.onerror即可处理
 对于未捕获的Promise异常，通过监听unhandledrejection事件可以达到需求
:::

:::important

对于事件回调函数里面的抛出的异常，不会中断程序的运行，并可以通过window.onerror捕获
react的错误边界的捕获就很巧妙的运用了这一特点

## Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

---

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
1. Another item
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
1. And another item.

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com/)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com/ "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com/ or <http://www.example.com/> and sometimes example.com (but not on GitHub, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org/
[1]: http://slashdot.org/
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com/

## Images

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style: ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style: ![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

Images from any folder can be used by providing path to file. Path should be relative to markdown file.

## Code

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```js {2}
function highlightMe() {
  console.log("This line can be highlighted!");
}
```

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

---

## Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
